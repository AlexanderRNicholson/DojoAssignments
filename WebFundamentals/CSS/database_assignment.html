              <h5>A structured set of data</h5>
              <p>Databases are a collection of information, they are used for
              creating, manipulating, and deleting data. There are many different
              types of databases and they can be classified in a basic approach of
              relational database or a non-relational database. Relationships means
              a set of our data is related to another section of our data.
              Meanwhile in a non-relational database there is not a common related
              section of our data. Our databases are put into sections of data
              called schemas, inside each schema each dataset is organised into
              tables, those tables contain columns and rows to house that
              particular set of data.</p>

              </div></a>
              <p>All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is housed
              on your hard drive. Oftentimes, large companies will have floors
              upon floors of just database storage (think NSA styled). Our computer
              stores information on the hard drive. We are able to create new
              information, read information, update information and delete
              information.</p>

              </div></a>
              <p>Since there could potentially be a lot of information a database
              stores, one problem we might run into is finding the data we are
              looking for. Imagine we had a room of books and you were asked to
              find the Coding Dojo Algorithm Book. Well, you might start picking
              up each book, checking the title and moving on to the next until
              you found it. That's very slow as most libraries discovered.
              Instead, if we were to ID each item we could find it quicker.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Interaction</h3>
              </div>
              <img src="https://s29.postimg.org/htw3dwaef/dbinteraction.png">
              <a href="https://www.google.com"><div class="read_more">
                 <span>Read More...</span>
               </div></a>
              <p>The amazing part about having a database is that it is a storage
              bin that holds onto all saved data. Well, if only one user had
              access to that data, it would be just like what we have built into
              our own computers. It wouldn't be useful to other users.
              However, the joy of having a database is that it is a storage bin
              many users can interact with, creating, reading, updating and deleting
               information that all users can see.</p>

              <p>There are a lot of large companies that specialise in the storing
               of information. As Big Data has erupted so too have the size and
              amount of companies on the market. That being said, a lot of their
             software is free for most users. Think of MySQL, which while being
            an incredible DB is completely free of cost and is used by a large
           company called Facebook.</p>
